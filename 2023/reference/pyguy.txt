I'll be around for a few days to answer any questions, comments, etc.

Thanks to /u/topaz2078 for creating these great puzzles (and the fun story), I've really enjoyed it!

Thanks to /u/pred, /u/xelf, and /u/badr for their fancy ideas,
/u/kaa-the-wise for their crazy one-liners, 
and to /u/asgardian28, /u/fquiver, /u/mebeim and many others for their feedback.

Hope to see you again next year!
