# Advent of Code 2023

This folder has solutions for Advent of Code 2023 in various languages. Although it has scaffolding for Rust, Python and C++, I will probably only use one language per day atleast initially.

We use `Justfiles` liberally to perform common tasks. You can run commands from a justfile from the folder its in, or from this folder by prefixing the path: i.e `cd rust && just run 5` is equivalent to `just rust/run 5`

## Fetching Puzzles

`just fetch <x>` will download the puzzle text and input for that day. The [aoc-cli](https://github.com/scarvalhojr/aoc-cli/) package must be installed for this to work.

## Templating

`just genday <x>` will generate templates for that day in a given language. These are generated from the `template` dirs using the `genday.sh` script.

## Running

`just run <x>` will run that day's solution

## Benchmarking

`just bench <x>` will benchmark that day's solution.

Python uses `pyperf` to run benchmarks, and Rust uses `criterion`.

After running the benchmarks from the language folder, you can run `just summarize_bench` from this folder to summarize the results from all languages into combined simple `csv` and `txt` files.

## Other

The rust folder has many other actions to e.g watch source files and rebuild, generate memory profiles, generate flamegraphs, run linters etc. Run `just --list` to view available actions.
